      <p>Our Vision: To enable, support and develop the spirit of Kannada among all Kannadigas around Tri State areas of New York as well as provide a link between Karnataka and Kannadigas around the world. We basically have three main purposes: Language maintenance, development and usage; art and culture development and growth; rich cultural heritage of Kannada Samkruti.
Our Mission: To have a connecting link with every Kannadiga that resides or lives as well as visits from Karnataka to be a part of Kannada Koota New York, perhaps one of the oldest organizations in the United States.
Our Message: Our message is simple and clear: Kannada Nudi, Naadu and Nede, meaning, speak, remember our land and follow the great steps that are hall mark of Kannada language and culture.</p>
